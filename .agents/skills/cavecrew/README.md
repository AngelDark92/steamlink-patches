# cavecrew

Decision guide. When to delegate to caveman subagents instead of doing the work inline.

## What it does

Tells the main thread when to spawn a caveman-style subagent versus the vanilla equivalent. The win: subagent tool-results inject back into main context verbatim, and caveman output is roughly 1/3 the size of vanilla prose. Across 20 delegations in one session, that is the difference between context exhaustion and finishing the task.

For this project, all build output, scratch checkouts and project caches always
go under `../builds/steamlink-patches/`. See [the layout](../../../diagnostics/build-layout/README.md).

Three subagents:

| Subagent | Job | Use when |
|----------|-----|----------|
| `cavecrew-investigator` | Locate code (read-only) | "Where is X defined / what calls Y / list uses of Z" |
| `cavecrew-builder` | Surgical edit, 1-2 files | Scope is obvious, ≤2 files. Refuses 3+ file scope. |
| `cavecrew-reviewer` | Diff/file review | One-line findings with severity emoji |

Use vanilla `Explore` or `Code Reviewer` when you want prose, architecture commentary, or rationale. Use main thread directly for one-line answers and 3+ file refactors.

This skill is a decision guide, not a slash command. It activates when the conversation mentions delegation.

## How to invoke

Triggers on phrases like "delegate to subagent", "use cavecrew", "spawn investigator", "save context", "compressed agent output".

## Under Hermes (delegate_task, not presets)

Hermes does not read `.github/agents/` and has no named agent presets. Run the three roles as
`delegate_task` children by pasting the matching contract from
[references/hermes-roles.md](references/hermes-roles.md) into each child's `context`, with the goal and
every path. Children inherit the parent's tools and model and cannot ask questions; their summaries are
self-reports the parent verifies.

## Example chaining

Locate → fix → verify (most common):

1. `cavecrew-investigator` returns site list (`path:line — symbol — note`)
2. Main thread picks 1-2 sites, hands paths to `cavecrew-builder`
3. `cavecrew-reviewer` audits the resulting diff

Parallel scout: spawn 2-3 `cavecrew-investigator` calls in one message with different angles (defs, callers, tests). Aggregate in main.

## Model overrides (Claude Code plugin hosts)

By default, `cavecrew-reviewer` and `cavecrew-investigator` pin `model: haiku` in their frontmatter; `cavecrew-builder` has no `model:` line (uses the API session default). Set env vars in your shell before launching Claude Code to override per-agent:

| Env var | Agent |
|---|---|
| `CAVECREW_REVIEWER_MODEL` | `cavecrew-reviewer` |
| `CAVECREW_BUILDER_MODEL` | `cavecrew-builder` |
| `CAVECREW_INVESTIGATOR_MODEL` | `cavecrew-investigator` |

Example — run reviewer on sonnet, keep others on default:

```sh
export CAVECREW_REVIEWER_MODEL=sonnet
```

Use the same model name strings you'd use in any Claude Code agent frontmatter (e.g. `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`).

Overrides patch only the `model:` line in the installed agent's frontmatter; the prompt body is untouched and keeps receiving upstream updates. Plugin installs only — standalone hook installs have no local agent files to patch. Unset or blank = no change. The patch persists in the installed file until the plugin is updated or reinstalled.
