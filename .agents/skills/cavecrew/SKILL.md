  Decision guide for delegating to caveman-style subagents. Tells the main
  thread WHEN to spawn `cavecrew-investigator` (locate code), `cavecrew-builder`
  (1-2 file edit), or `cavecrew-reviewer` (diff review) instead of doing the
  work inline or using vanilla `Explore`. Subagent output is caveman-compressed
  so the tool-result injected back into main context is ~60% smaller — main
  context lasts longer across long sessions.
  Trigger: "delegate to subagent", "use cavecrew", "spawn investigator/builder/reviewer",
  "save context", "compressed agent output".

Cavecrew = three subagent presets that emit caveman output. Same job as Anthropic defaults (`Explore`, edit-style agents, reviewer); difference is the tool-result they return is compressed, so main context shrinks per delegation.

## Under Hermes (delegate_task, not presets)

Hermes does not read `.github/agents/` and has no named agent presets. Run `cavecrew-investigator`,
`cavecrew-builder` and `cavecrew-reviewer` as `delegate_task` children: paste the matching role contract
from [references/hermes-roles.md](references/hermes-roles.md) verbatim into each child's `context`, with
the goal and every path. Children inherit the parent's tools and model (no per-child tool list, no `haiku`
pin) and cannot call `clarify` — keep the `ambiguous. ask:` terminal line. A child's summary is a
self-report: the parent re-reads the cited lines and runs the checks itself.

## Numeric style

Write numeric quantities and ordinals as digits (`1`, `2`, `3`, `1st`, `2nd`), not spelled-out number words. Preserve exact quotes, identifiers, commands, and established names unchanged. Apply this to delegated prompts, subagent output, and the main-thread summary.

## When to use cavecrew vs alternatives

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| "Where is X defined / what calls Y / list uses of Z" | `cavecrew-investigator` |
| Same but you also want suggestions/architecture commentary | `Explore` (vanilla) |
| Surgical edit, ≤2 files, scope obvious | `cavecrew-builder` |
| New feature / 3+ files / cross-cutting refactor | Main thread or `feature-dev:code-architect` |
| Review diff, branch, or file for bugs | `cavecrew-reviewer` |
| Deep code review with rationale + alternatives | `Code Reviewer` (vanilla) |
| One-line answer you already know | Main thread, no subagent |

Rule of thumb: **if you'd want the subagent's output in 1/3 the tokens, pick cavecrew. If you'd want prose, pick vanilla.**

## Why this exists (the real win)

Subagent tool results get injected into main context verbatim. A vanilla `Explore` that returns 2k tokens of prose costs 2k tokens of main-context budget every time. The same finding from `cavecrew-investigator` returns ~700 tokens. Across 20 delegations in one session that's the difference between context exhaustion and finishing the task.

## Output contracts

What main thread can rely on per agent:

**`cavecrew-investigator`**
```
<Header>:
- path:line — `symbol` — short note
totals: <counts>.
```
Or `No match.` Always file-path-first, line-number-attached, backticked symbols. Safe to grep with `path:\d+`.

**`cavecrew-builder`**
```
<path:line-range> — <change ≤10 words>.
verified: <re-read OK | mismatch @ path:line>.
```
Or one of: `too-big.` / `needs-confirm.` / `ambiguous.` / `regressed.` (terminal first token).

**`cavecrew-reviewer`**
```
path:line: <emoji> <severity>: <problem>. <fix>.
totals: N🔴 N🟡 N🔵 N❓
```
Or `No issues.` Findings sorted file → line ascending.

## Chaining patterns

For every delegated task in this project, pass the repository's `AGENTS.md` and
the external build contract: all generated outputs, temporary checkouts, logs and
project caches belong under `../builds/steamlink-patches/` (on this workspace,
`D:/Angelo/Desktop/SteamLink-GalaxyXR-Windows-Toolkit-FULL/builds/steamlink-patches`).
Gradle uses `gradle/root` and `gradle/patches`; mixed retained fixtures/tools/evidence
use `build/`; native CMake uses `extensions/<name>/build-*` there. Do not create
repository-local build trees or clean retained inputs wholesale. See
[the build layout](../../../diagnostics/build-layout/README.md) and the local
[agent presets](../../../.github/agents/). Reviewers must check output routing,
release consumers and clean/input separation. Static routing checks and cached
compiler passes do not establish a successful Morphe Gradle or GitHub CI build.

For Steam Link patch/test changes in this repository, include fresh-checkout input availability in the investigator/reviewer task. Use the [Morphe skill](../morphe-patches/SKILL.md) CI guidance: local ignored decoded APKs are not GitHub inputs, and absent-input audits must be distinguished from mandatory portable tests.

For build/CI failures, give the investigator the exact commit/run/job and first
failed task. Ask the reviewer to compare imported test libraries with Gradle test
dependency declarations, and to check that the full Gradle test/Android/catalog
gate precedes release preparation. A manual classpath or desktop fat JAR may
contain undeclared libraries: compressed reports must label fallback checks as
diagnostic, not Gradle/CI proof. Include actual commands, compiler/runtime versions
and executed/skipped counts; only the corrected SHA's workflow can establish its
CI result. Main thread retains responsibility for this final verification.
For external release bundles, reviewers must verify exact-version canonical
absolute attestation paths (`..` is rejected even in absolute patterns) and the
Gradle-only clean before release rebuilding, preventing stale preflight uploads.
Run the release path regression with the actual toolkit glob dependency. Local
Packages setup uses `tools/Configure-GitHubPackages.ps1`; never ask for a token
in chat, print it, or store it in the repository.

**Locate → fix → verify** (most common):
1. `cavecrew-investigator` returns site list.
2. Main thread picks 1-2 sites, hands paths to `cavecrew-builder`.
3. `cavecrew-reviewer` audits the diff.

**Parallel scout** (when investigation is broad):
Spawn 2-3 `cavecrew-investigator` calls in one message (different angles: defs vs callers vs tests). Aggregate in main thread.

**Single-shot edit** (when site is already known):
Skip investigator. Hand exact path:line to `cavecrew-builder` directly.

## What NOT to do

- Don't use `cavecrew-builder` when you don't already know the file. Spawn investigator first or main thread will eat tokens passing context.
- Don't chain `cavecrew-investigator → cavecrew-builder` for a 5-file refactor. Builder will return `too-big.` and you'll have wasted a turn.
- Don't ask `cavecrew-reviewer` for "general feedback" — it returns findings only, no architecture opinions. Use `Code Reviewer` for that.
- Don't expect prose. Cavecrew output is structured, sometimes terse to the point of cryptic. If a human will read it directly, paraphrase.

## Auto-clarity (inherited)

Subagents drop caveman → normal English for security warnings, irreversible-action confirmations, and any output where fragment ambiguity could be misread. Resume caveman after.
